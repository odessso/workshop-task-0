Here is the URL to the webpage for this project: https://odessso.github.io/workshop-task-0/

## Task Description:
- Experiment using at least one of the following 2D primitive shapes using line, triangle, quad, arc etc

## Notes:
- Focused on experimenting with moving rectangular shapes and calling them back to the original starting position.

## Problems Faced:
- Code is not as concise as I would life it to be. Would be good to go back and use more concise forms of repeating code as seen in the Workshop 2 tutorial.
